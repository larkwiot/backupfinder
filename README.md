The Backup Bruteforcer script will ask you for the link to the given file you want to find a backup of. Give it the full link, that means INCLUDE THE SUBDOMAIN!! 

There is not an official license for this script. That is because it is a quick and dirty tool anyone could write. It's just meant to be a base for whatever else you might need.

It'd be appreciated if you told everyone here about the changes you make to optimize the script, but that's your choice to do so or not.
